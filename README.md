# PerfectWorld 6

**This incomplete mod is not the same mod as PerfectWorld6 available on the Steam Workshop.
I started porting Civ 5's PerfectWorld before that mod was released.
I don't intend to continue work on this version.**

Version 6.1

PerfectWorld 6 is a Civilization 6 port of the PerfectWorld3 (version 5b) map
script, which was written by Rich Marinaccio for Civilization 5 and updated
by Bobert13 of the CivFanatics Forums (https://forums.civfanatics.com).
This port also includes code from the Planet Simulator (version LL3) map
script, which was written by Bobert13 for Civilization 5 based on his work,
for PerfectWorld3, and updated by LamilLerran, also of the CivFanatics
Forums.

This map script uses various manipulations of Perlin noise to create
landforms, and generates climate based on a simplified model of geostrophic
and monsoon wind patterns. Rivers are generated along accurate drainage paths
governed by the elevation map used to create the landforms.
